# Pi Web

[中文文档](./README.zh-CN.md) | [日本語](./README.ja.md) | [Русский](./README.ru.md)

Local browser UI for the [pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). Pi Web uses the same local configuration and session files as pi, so you can browse and resume conversations, run agent turns, configure models and resources, and inspect project files from a browser.

## Features

- **Session workspace**: browse, resume, rename, export, and delete conversations grouped by project, with running state, context usage, cost, and compaction details.
- **Two ways to branch**: **New session** creates an independent session file from an earlier message; **Edit from here** creates a branch inside the current session.
- **Project file tools**: browse and upload files, inspect Git diffs, and preview source, Markdown, images, audio, PDFs, and DOCX files with automatic refresh.
- **Git worktrees**: switch checkouts from the sidebar while keeping sessions from the same repository grouped together.
- **Web-based configuration**: manage provider login and API keys, models, model tests, plugin packages, and skills without leaving Pi Web.
- **English and Simplified Chinese UI**: Pi Web follows the browser language initially and provides a language switcher in the top bar.

## Quick Start

Pi Web requires Node.js 22.19.0 or newer. Check your version with `node --version`, then run:

```bash
npx @agegr/pi-web@latest
```

The CLI opens a browser after the server is ready. If it does not, open [http://127.0.0.1:30141](http://127.0.0.1:30141). Pi Web listens only on `127.0.0.1` by default.

If no model provider is configured yet, open the **Models** panel to sign in or add an API key.

To install the `pi-web` command globally:

```bash
npm install -g @agegr/pi-web@latest
pi-web
```

To update, stop the running process with `Ctrl+C` and run the same install command again. To uninstall, run `npm uninstall -g @agegr/pi-web`.

## Configuration

For port and hostname, command-line options override the corresponding environment variables. Either `--no-open` or `PI_WEB_NO_OPEN=1` disables automatic browser opening.

| Option or environment variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--port <port>`, `-p <port>`, or `PORT` | Server port | `30141` |
| `--hostname <host>`, `-H <host>`, or `PI_WEB_HOSTNAME` | Bind hostname | `127.0.0.1` |
| `--no-open` or `PI_WEB_NO_OPEN=1` | Do not open a browser automatically | Browser opens |
| `PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Additional exact proxy or custom hostnames, comma-separated | Unset |
| `PI_WEB_PASSWORD` | Enable HTTP Basic Auth; the username is always `pi` | Authentication disabled |

For example:

```bash
pi-web --port 8080              # custom port
pi-web --hostname 0.0.0.0       # expose on a trusted network
pi-web -p 8080 -H 0.0.0.0       # combine options
pi-web --no-open                # do not open the browser automatically

PORT=8080 pi-web                # environment variable is also supported
PI_WEB_HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 pi-web  # explicit network exposure
PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS=pi-web.internal pi-web  # allow an exact proxy/custom hostname
PI_WEB_PASSWORD='a-long-random-password' pi-web  # require Basic Auth (username: pi)
PI_WEB_NO_OPEN=1 pi-web         # useful when running as a background service

# Optional multi-account app login for a trusted HTTPS reverse proxy:
PI_WEB_AUTH_REQUIRED=1 \
PI_WEB_AUTH_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/absolute/path/to/credentials.json \
PI_WEB_AUTH_SESSION_SECRET_FILE=/absolute/path/to/session-secret \
PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS=pi.example.com \
pi-web
```

The credentials file uses `{"credentials":[{"username":"name","password":"secret"}]}` and should have mode `600`. The legacy `PI_WEB_AUTH_USERNAME` + `PI_WEB_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE` single-account settings remain supported, but cannot be combined with the multi-account file. Application authentication is disabled unless auth settings are present. When enabled, `/login` creates a signed HttpOnly session cookie bound to the matching account; set `PI_WEB_AUTH_REQUIRED=1` in public deployments so missing credentials fail closed. Pi Web can invoke a high-privilege agent, so do not expose it through plain HTTP or without a trusted HTTPS reverse proxy.

### Remote Access

Set `PI_WEB_PASSWORD` to protect the web interface and every API endpoint with HTTP Basic Auth. The username is always `pi`. Leaving the variable unset or empty disables authentication.

Pi Web can invoke a high-privilege agent. Basic Auth does not encrypt the password in transit, so do not expose plain HTTP to the internet. Use HTTPS through a trusted reverse proxy or a trusted VPN for remote access.
`PI_WEB_PASSWORD` and the `PI_WEB_AUTH_*` application-login settings are mutually exclusive. Configuring both fails closed instead of stacking two login mechanisms. Installed PWAs should use the application login because native Basic Auth prompts are not reliable there.
API requests accept loopback names, IP literals, the selected bind hostname, and exact comma-separated names in `PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. Configure that variable when a trusted reverse proxy uses a different external hostname.

### Later fork operations

The long-lived Later branch keeps its current upstream baseline in [`PROJECT_STATE.md`](./PROJECT_STATE.md). Its [custom feature/configuration inventory](./docs/later-customizations.zh-CN.md), [Linux deployment guide](./docs/linux-deployment.zh-CN.md), and [upstream sync/incident playbook](./docs/maintenance-playbook.zh-CN.md) are maintained in Chinese. Run `./scripts/check-upstream.sh` for a read-only drift check before merging upstream changes.

Basic Auth does not encrypt the password in transit. Do not expose Pi Web over plain HTTP to the internet; use HTTPS through a trusted reverse proxy or a trusted VPN. If a reverse proxy sends an external hostname, add that exact name to `PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. This allow-list does not change the address Pi Web binds to.

### HTTP Proxy

Server-side model and API requests honor the standard `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables.

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 \
npx @agegr/pi-web@latest
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:HTTP_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
$env:NO_PROXY = "localhost,127.0.0.1"
npx @agegr/pi-web@latest
```

## Features

- **Pick work back up**: browse previous pi conversations by project without digging through terminal history or session paths.
- **Try different directions safely**: continue from an earlier message or fork a session into a separate route.
- **Work across branches**: switch Git worktrees from the sidebar so new sessions and the Explorer follow the checkout you choose.
- **Chat beside the project**: browse files on the left and preview source, docs, images, audio, and PDFs on the right while the agent works.
- **See session state clearly**: context usage, cost, compaction state, and system prompt details are visible from the top bar.
- **Configure less from the terminal**: manage models, login/API keys, model tests, and skill switches from the web UI.
- **Use the interface in your language**: switch between the supported UI languages from the top bar.
- **Inspect Chat execution transcripts**: sessions in `~/.pi/agent/chat-sessions` are labeled as Chat-managed, read-only evidence. They can be viewed or exported, but not resumed, forked, renamed, or deleted.
- **Switch execution devices inside one Pi Web**: a bounded device directory plus a same-origin sticky gateway keeps one URL, login, PWA, and interface while routing the full page/API/SSE lifecycle to the selected Mac/Linux/workstation. Per-device URLs remain deployment and break-glass adapters.

## Notes

- **Data directory**: Pi Web reads `~/.pi/agent/sessions` by default. Set `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` to point at another pi agent directory.
- **Session files**: files are stored as `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`.
- **Chat-managed sessions**: Pi Web also reads `~/.pi/agent/chat-sessions/<timestamp>_chat-<tool-execution-id>.jsonl`; these transcripts are not resumable pi-web workspaces.
- **Model config**: the Models panel reads and writes `models.json` in the pi agent directory. Model lists and defaults come from pi's config.
- **File access**: file browsing and preview are scoped to the selected project directory and working directories that appear in sessions.
- **Git worktrees**: see [Worktrees in Pi Web](./docs/worktrees.md) for when the switcher appears, how new worktrees are created, and what removal does.
- **Forks vs in-session branches**: Fork creates a new `.jsonl` file. "Edit from here" creates another branch inside the same session file.
- **Internationalization**: see [Internationalization](./docs/i18n.md) for using translations and adding languages or UI text.

### Downstream Session Context Menu

Electron wrappers and other downstream integrations can provide a session-row
context menu without patching `SessionSidebar`. Listen for the cancelable
`pi-web:session-row-contextmenu` browser event and call `preventDefault()`
synchronously when the integration will handle it:

```js
window.addEventListener("pi-web:session-row-contextmenu", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const { id, path, cwd, name, clientX, clientY, refresh } = event.detail;

  void openSessionMenu({ id, path, cwd, name, clientX, clientY }).then((changed) => {
    if (changed) refresh();
  });
});
```

The detail object contains `id`, `path`, `cwd`, optional `name`, pointer
coordinates, and a `refresh()` callback for actions that change the session
list. If no listener cancels the extension event, Pi Web preserves the
browser's native context menu. This hook is browser-side and independent of
Pi agent extensions.

## Development

The multi-device decision, deployed same-origin gateway, performance limits, and failure modes are documented in [Multi-device architecture (Chinese)](./docs/multi-device-architecture.zh-CN.md).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs at [http://127.0.0.1:30141](http://127.0.0.1:30141). Run the common checks with:

```bash
npm test
node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
node --test lib/*.test.mjs components/*.test.mjs hooks/*.test.mjs
```

Do not run `next build` or `npm run build` during normal development. It writes to `.next/` and can interfere with the development server; leave builds for release work.
